# Overview

This is an example of the classic Brick Breaker game. The goal of this game is to break all the bricks with the ball. The user controls the paddle to be able to get the ball to collide with the bricks. This is one of my first experiences in the Java language. 

This program helped teach me how to: work with Java classes, how to import a variety of packages, incorperate for loops and conditionals, and taught me how to build a variety of functions.

The main purpose of why I chose this particular project is because I want to gain a deeper understanding of graphic design and colors in the Java language.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program is done in Visual Studio Code

This program is done in the Java language imported libraries include: 
javax.swing.JFrame - to open a window for the game
java.awt.Color, java.awt.Graphics, java.awt.Graphics2D- these are graphic libraries to beable to control the object colors
java.awt.event.ActionEvent, java.awt.event.ActionListener, java.awt.event.KeyEvent, java.awt.event.KeyListener- these help the user be able to control the program with the keyboad function
java.awt.Rectangle- this library defines the objects and makes them display on the screen

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* add more descriptive comments into my code for future reference
* add more functions into the game such as: multiple levels, a score board, multiple balls, or more bricks
* Add more detail into the graphics such as learning how to add file images as the sprites.
